# AOE-II-Image-Map-Generator
Make AOE II DE Maps from Images.

Image goes in.

AOE II DE map comes out. Magic.

User selects:

1. What size map they want to create (script downscales image)
2. how many colors they want the image to be (each color is assigned to a terrain type)
3. how simplified the image should be (runs a gaussian filter)

then the script shits out a aoe2scenaior script with a list of pixel locations and what terrain type should be at that location.

Need to work out how to generate resources.... getting there
